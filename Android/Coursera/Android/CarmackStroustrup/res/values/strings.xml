        One of the most influential innovations to come along with computers is the rise of modern video games. John Carmack founded id Software, and created some of the most influential video games in what is the fastest growing entertainment medium in the United States. In 2011 the video game industry as a whole was valued at $65 billion. Carmack’s influence on this industry has been widespread as id Software’s Wolfenstein 3d set codified the first person shooter genre (one of the most popular video game genres) in 1992.
